# PUN2-Room-Connection
A simple code to make your life (slightly) easier. I made this for college, don't judge me (hi teacher).

Just simply insert the Connection.cs script in any gameobject (but preferably the button where you execute the commands).
If you want to see the code working, just download the Unity Example folder, set the PUN up and test it. :)
